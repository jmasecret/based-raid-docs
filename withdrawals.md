# 💵 Withdrawals

Claim your raised funds after a successful raid!

## ✅ Withdrawal Requirements

Before you can withdraw, **ALL** of these must be true:

| Requirement | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ✅ **Target Met** | Raised amount ≥ target amount |
| ⏰ **Lock Period Passed** | 30min (verified) or 1hr (standard) |
| 👤 **You Are Creator** | Only the original creator can withdraw |
| 🔒 **Not Already Withdrawn** | Each raid can only be withdrawn once |

## ⏱️ Lock Periods

After your target is met, there's a mandatory waiting period:

| Raid Type | Lock Period | Why? |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| ✅ **Verified** | 30 minutes | Trusted creators get faster access |
| 📋 **Standard** | 1 hour | Protection against quick rugs |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Time-Locks?**

Time-locks give the community a safety window. The lock period starts when the target is **first met**, not when the raid ends.

{% hint style="success" %}
**On-Chain Verification**

Your tier is verified automatically by reading your $BASEDBOT token balance during withdrawal. No trust assumptions!
{% endhint %}

## 💰 Revenue Share

Top-tier holders also earn **revenue share** from the platform:

| Tier | Revenue Share |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 🐋 **Whale** | **15%** of platform fees |
| 🦍 **Based Ape** | **5%** of platform fees |

## 🎁 Donor Rewards Pool

**20% of every successful raid's platform fee** is automatically sent to the **Donor Rewards Pool**.

| Flow | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 💰 **Source** | 20% of the platform fee on every successful withdrawal |
| 🏦 **Destination** | Dedicated Donor Pool wallet |
| 🎯 **Purpose** | Rewards distributed to active donors |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Incentive Alignment**

Donors don't just give—they also earn! The more raids succeed, the larger the pool grows. This creates a virtuous cycle where everyone benefits from successful CTO recoveries.
