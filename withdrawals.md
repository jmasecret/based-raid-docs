# 💵 Withdrawals

Claim your raised funds after a successful raid!

## ✅ Withdrawal Requirements

Before you can withdraw, **ALL** of these must be true:

| Requirement | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ✅ **Target Met** | Raised amount ≥ target amount |
| ⏰ **Lock Period Passed** | 30min (verified) or 1hr (standard) |
| 👤 **You Are Creator** | Only the original creator can withdraw |
| 🔒 **Not Already Withdrawn** | Each raid can only be withdrawn once |

## ⏱️ Lock Periods

After your target is met, there's a mandatory waiting period:

| Raid Type | Lock Period | Why? |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| ✅ **Verified** | 30 minutes | Trusted creators get faster access |
| 📋 **Standard** | 1 hour | Protection against quick rugs |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why Time-Locks?**

Time-locks give the community a safety window. The lock period starts when the target is **first met**, not when the raid ends.

## 💸 Platform Fees

A platform fee is deducted from withdrawals:

| Raid Type | Fee | Example (10 SOL raised) |
| --------- | --- | ----------------------- |
| ✅ **Verified** | 3% | You receive **9.7 SOL** |
| 📋 **Standard** | 5% | You receive **9.5 SOL** |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Get Verified = Save Money!**

Verified raids pay only 3% vs 5% standard. On a 100 SOL raise, that's 2 SOL saved!
