# Withdrawals

This guide explains how creators withdraw funds from successful raids.

## Withdrawal Requirements

Before you can withdraw, **ALL** of these must be true:

| Requirement             | Details                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Target Met            | Raised amount ≥ target amount                       |
| ✅ Lock Period Passed    | 30min (verified) or 1hr (standard) after target met |
| ✅ You Are Creator       | Only the original creator can withdraw              |
| ✅ Not Already Withdrawn | Each raid can only be withdrawn once                |

## Lock Periods

After your target is met, there's a mandatory waiting period:

| Raid Type | Lock Period | Why?                            |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Verified  | 30 minutes  | Trusted creators, faster access |
| Standard  | 1 hour      | Protection against quick rugs   |
