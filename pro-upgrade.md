# ⚡ PRO Upgrade

Unlock ultra-deep on-chain analytics for any Solana token using the x402 protocol.

## 🔓 Why Upgrade?

Consult Oracle provides basic safety checks for all $BASEDBOT holders. However, professional traders and researchers require deeper insights to stay ahead of the curve. The **PRO Report** reveals coordinated wallet behavior, whale movements, and internal security audits that basic tools miss.

## 💳 Access Tiers

BasedRaid offers three ways to access the PRO Report:

| Tier | Requirement | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🦍 **Based Ape** | Hold 1,000,000+ $BASEDBOT | **FREE** |
| 🐋 **Whale** | Hold 10,000,000+ $BASEDBOT | **FREE** |
| 🛡️ **Paid Pro** | Single CA Analysis | **0.10 USDC** |

{% hint style="success" %}
**HODL for Free Access**
Holding $BASEDBOT not only gives you free PRO access but also connects you to the project's long-term growth. Check your tier progress in the dApp header!

## 🚀 How to Upgrade (x402)

If you don't meet the token holding requirements, you can upgrade a specific contract analysis instantly using the **x402 protocol**.

### Step 1: Request Pro
Enter a Contract Address and click the **"⚡ Upgrade to Pro Report"** button below the initial verdict.

### Step 2: Sign Transaction
A modal will appear requesting **0.10 USDC**. Click **"Unlock Pro Report"** and sign the transaction in your wallet. 
*Note: We use the Dexter facilitator to ensure zero-fee gasless transactions for users.*

### Step 3: View Report
Once the transaction is verified on-chain, the full suite of PRO metrics will unlock instantly for that token.

## 🧾 Payment Receipts
Every paid upgrade generates a cryptographic receipt compliant with the x402 protocol.
- **Verification**: You will see a `⚡ x402 ✓` badge in the verdict section.
- **Transparency**: Click the **"Payment Receipt"** link to view the transaction directly on Solscan.
