# 🎁 Donor Rewards Pool

Earn rewards for supporting successful raids!

## 🌟 How It Works

Every time a raid succeeds and the creator withdraws, **20% of the platform fee** is automatically sent to the **Donor Rewards Pool**.

**Incentive Alignment**

Donors don't just give—they also earn! The more raids you support, the more you benefit from the ecosystem's success.
{% endhint %}

## 📊 Revenue Flow

When a raid is successfully withdrawn, the platform fee is split:

| Recipient | Percentage | Description |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 🏛️ **Treasury** | **80%** | Platform operations & token buybacks |
| 🎁 **Donor Pool** | **20%** | Distributed to active donors |

### 💡 Example

For a **10 SOL** raid with a **5% platform fee** (0.5 SOL):

| Recipient | Amount |
| --------- | ------ |
| 💰 **Creator** | **9.5 SOL** |
| 🏛️ **Treasury** | **0.4 SOL** (80% of fee) |
| 🎁 **Donor Pool** | **0.1 SOL** (20% of fee) |
