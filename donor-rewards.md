# 💯 Donor Rewards

Earn rewards for supporting successful raids!

## 🌟 How It Works

Every time a raid succeeds and the creator withdraws, **20% of the platform fee** is automatically sent to the **Donor Rewards Pool**.

**Incentive Alignment**

Donors don't just give—they also earn! The more raids you support, the more you benefit from the ecosystem's success.

## 📊 Revenue Flow

When a raid is successfully withdrawn, the platform fee is split:

| Recipient         | Percentage | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 🏛️ **Treasury**  | **80%**    | Platform operations & token buybacks |
| 🎁 **Donor Pool** | **20%**    | Distributed to active donors         |

### 💡 Tier-Based Examples (10 SOL Raid)

The platform fee depends on the creator's **$BASEDBOT holder tier**, verified on-chain:

| 🐋 **Whale** | 1% | 0.10 SOL | 0.08 SOL | **0.02 SOL** | 9.90 SOL |
