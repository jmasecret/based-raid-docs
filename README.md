## BasedRaid Documentation

Welcome to the BasedRaid documentation. BasedRaid is a **trustless recovery protocol** for Community Takeovers (CTOs) on Solana.


{% hint style="warning" %}
**🚧 DEVNET PHASE**

BasedRaid is currently live on **Solana Devnet only**. All SOL used is **test SOL with no real value**.

To get started, switch your wallet to Devnet and get free test SOL from the [Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

### What is BasedRaid?

BasedRaid allows communities to raise funds for token recovery efforts through a secure, trustless system:

* 💰 **Funds are held in a vault (PDA)** - Not controlled by the creator
* 🎯 **Target-based release** - Funds only released when target is met
* 💸 **Claimable refunds** - If target isn't met by deadline, donors can claim 100% refund
* ✅ **Verified creators** - Lower fees and faster withdrawals for verified raids
* 🔗 **Shareable links** - Every raid has a unique shareable URL
* 🏆 **Top donors leaderboard** - Recognition for top contributors
