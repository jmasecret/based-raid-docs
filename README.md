## ⚠️ Important Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Real SOL**

BasedRaid mainnet uses real SOL. Always double-check amounts before confirming transactions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Non-Custodial**

BasedRaid never controls your funds. Everything is held in on-chain vaults (PDAs) controlled by immutable smart contract logic.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Do Your Research**

Always verify raid creators before donating. Check their history, trust badges, and linked socials.
