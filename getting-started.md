## Important Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Devnet Only**

BasedRaid currently runs on Devnet. All SOL is test currency with no real value.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Non-Custodial**

BasedRaid never has access to your funds. All funds are held in on-chain vaults (PDAs) controlled by smart contract logic.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Do Your Research**

Always verify the legitimacy of a raid before donating. Check the creator's history and the linked token contract.
