### Important Notes

> ⚠️ **Real Money**: All transactions on BasedRaid use real SOL. Make sure you understand how the platform works before creating or donating to raids.

> 🔒 **Non-Custodial**: BasedRaid never has access to your funds. All funds are held in on-chain vaults (PDAs) controlled by smart contract logic.

> 💡 **Do Your Research**: Always verify the legitimacy of a raid before donating. Check the creator's history and the linked token contract.
