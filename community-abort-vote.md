# 🗳️ Community Abort Vote

Protect yourself from rugs with the Community Abort Vote feature!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Power to the Donors**

During the time-lock period after a raid meets its target, donors can vote to abort the raid. If 51%+ of the donated SOL votes to abort, the raid fails and **all donors get 100% refunds**.
{% endhint %}

## 🎯 How It Works

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1️⃣ **Target Met** | Raid reaches its fundraising goal |
| 2️⃣ **Time-Lock Begins** | 30min (verified) or 1hr (standard) countdown starts |
| 3️⃣ **Voting Window Open** | Donors can vote to abort during this time |
| 4️⃣ **51% Threshold** | If 51%+ of donated SOL votes abort, raid is cancelled |
| 5️⃣ **Refunds Enabled** | All donors can claim 100% refunds (no fees) |

## ⏱️ Voting Window

| Raid Type | Time-Lock | Voting Window |
| --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| ✅ **Verified** | 30 minutes | 30 minutes to vote |
| 📋 **Standard** | 1 hour | 1 hour to vote |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Vote Early!**

Once the time-lock expires, the creator can withdraw and voting closes. Make sure to vote before the countdown ends!
{% endhint %}

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## 💰 Voting Power

Your voting power is proportional to your donation:

| Your Donation | Total Raised | Your Voting Power |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 SOL | 10 SOL | 10% |
| 5 SOL | 10 SOL | 50% |
| 10 SOL | 10 SOL | 100% |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Democratic Majority**

The 51% threshold ensures a true majority of donors must agree to abort, preventing small donors from gaming the system.
{% endhint %}

## ⚠️ Important Notes

| Rule | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| 🔒 **Votes are Final** | Once you vote, you cannot undo it |
| ⏰ **Time-Limited** | Voting only available during time-lock |
| 💯 **Full Refund** | Aborted raids give 100% refunds (0% fee) |
| 🚫 **Creator Blocked** | Creators cannot withdraw from aborted raids |

## 🛡️ Why This Matters

The Community Abort Vote gives the time-lock **real teeth**:

| Before | After |
| ------ | ----- |
| Time-lock only delays creator | Donors can take action |
| No recourse after target met | Community can veto suspicious activity |
| Hope for the best | Vote for your interests |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Trustless Protection**

This feature is enforced on-chain. No admin can override it, and no creator can bypass it.
